(* EXCEPTIONS *)

(* This is a marker for places in the code that you have to fill in.
   Your completed assignment should never raise this exception. *)
exception ImplementMe of string

(* This exception is thrown when a type error occurs during evaluation
   (e.g., attempting to invoke something that's not a function).
   You should provide a useful error message.
*)
exception DynamicTypeError of string

(* This exception is thrown when pattern matching fails during evaluation. *)  
exception MatchFailure  

(* EVALUATION *)

(* See if a value matches a given pattern.  If there is a match, return
   an environment for any name bindings in the pattern.  If there is not
   a match, raise the MatchFailure exception.

(* Evaluate an expression in the given environment and return the
   associated value.  Raise a MatchFailure if pattern matching fails.
   Raise a DynamicTypeError if any other kind of error occurs (e.g.,
   trying to add a boolean to an integer) which prevents evaluation
   from continuing.
